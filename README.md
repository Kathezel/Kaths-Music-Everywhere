# Kaths-Music-Everywhere

**You want to hear all the sound tracks minecraft has to offer and you don't want to travel to all the biomes just to listen to them? Now you can listen to them everywhere! No more lock music behind biomes.**

# What does it do?
It let the game play every piece of music everywhere, no more music locked behind specific biomes.
All overworld music plays in the overworld, all nether biome music plays the the nether (only in the new biomes). Because the end does not have that much music there the music is still the same as normal.

# How to install:
Just put it into the rescorepack folder and activate it.

# Notes:
The pack should work from 1.19-1.20.2. All versions below 1.20.2 minecraft says it "made for a newer version" but it should still work.

If Minecraft adds more songs this R-Pack needs to be updated for that, as long no more music will be add, this R-Pack should work fine.
